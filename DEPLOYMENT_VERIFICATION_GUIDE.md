# Deployment Verification Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
The production deployment is still using the **old version** with html2canvas, causing OKLCH errors. The new native screenshot implementation needs to be deployed.

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. **Check Deployment Version**
After deployment, press `Ctrl+Shift+V` on the website to see the version panel:
- ✅ **Version**: Should show `2.0.0-native-screenshot`
- ✅ **Native Screenshot**: Should be `true`
- ✅ **html2canvas Removed**: Should be `true`
- ✅ **Deployment Fixes**: Should be `true`

### 2. **Check Console Logs**
Open browser console and look for these logs when the bug report component loads:
```
🐛 Component version: NATIVE_SCREENSHOT_ONLY - No html2canvas
🐛 Starting native screen capture - VERSION: NATIVE_ONLY_NO_HTML2CANVAS
🐛 html2canvas should NOT be available: false
```

### 3. **Test Screenshot Functionality**
1. Click the bug report button (red bug icon)
2. Click "Capture Screen" button
3. Should see: "Please select the browser window to capture your screen"
4. Should NOT see any OKLCH errors in console

## 🔧 Deployment Commands

### **For Vercel Deployment:**
```bash
# Force a fresh deployment (clears cache)
vercel --prod --force

# Or trigger a new deployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force deployment - native screenshot implementation"
git push origin main
```

### **For Other Platforms:**
```bash
# Clear build cache and redeploy
npm run build
# Deploy using your platform's method
```

## 📁 Files Changed (Verify These Are Deployed)

### **Core Changes:**
1. **`TMS-PASSENGER/components/floating-bug-report-button.tsx`**:
   - ❌ Removed: `import html2canvas from 'html2canvas';`
   - ✅ Added: Native Screen Capture API implementation
   - ✅ Added: Version logging for verification

2. **`TMS-PASSENGER/package.json`**:
   - ❌ Removed: `"html2canvas": "^1.4.1"`
   - ❌ Removed: `"@types/html2canvas": "^0.5.35"`

3. **`TMS-PASSENGER/lib/razorpay.ts`**:

   - ✅ Fixed: Build-time configuration errors

4. **`TMS-PASSENGER/next.config.ts`**:

   - ✅ Simplified: Webpack configuration

### **New Files:**
5. **`TMS-PASSENGER/public/version.json`**: Version tracking
6. **`TMS-PASSENGER/components/deployment-version-check.tsx`**: Version verification UI

## 🐛 Expected Behavior After Deployment

### **Before (Old Version - BROKEN)**:
```
❌ Error capturing screenshot: Error: Attempting to parse an unsupported color function "oklch"
❌ Error submitting bug report: ReferenceError: setUploadedFiles is not defined
```

### **After (New Version - WORKING)**:
```
✅ 🐛 Component version: NATIVE_SCREENSHOT_ONLY - No html2canvas
✅ 🐛 Starting native screen capture - VERSION: NATIVE_ONLY_NO_HTML2CANVAS
✅ Screenshot captured successfully!
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If OKLCH Errors Still Occur:**
1. **Check Browser Cache**: Hard refresh with `Ctrl+F5`
2. **Check CDN Cache**: May need to wait for CDN cache to clear
3. **Verify Deployment**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+V` to check version
4. **Check Build Logs**: Ensure html2canvas was not reinstalled

### **If Version Panel Shows Old Version:**
1. **Deployment Failed**: Check deployment logs
2. **Build Cache**: Clear build cache and redeploy
3. **Git Issues**: Ensure all changes are committed and pushed

### **If Native Screenshot Doesn't Work:**
1. **HTTPS Required**: Screen Capture API requires HTTPS
2. **Browser Support**: Chrome 72+, Firefox 66+, Safari 13+
3. **User Permission**: User must grant screen capture permission
